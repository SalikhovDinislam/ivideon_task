make [all] - to build everything
make check - to run available tests

After building everything server is available at dist/server/led_server.
It can be run by just `./dist/server/led_server'.
Client is a single script ./client/client.sh
Note that there is a limitation that client and server are to be run
from the same directory. It may be fixed in the following versions.
